      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s the story of how we met and what happened:
        <br /><br />
        Once upon a time, I thought I had found love. Her name was Darathi, and I gave her my heart, but she broke it like it was nothing. I met her at my institute. She looked beautiful, and I thought my charm had won her over. I got attached quickly, as I always do. I used to pick her up, drop her home, and spend all day talking to her. We went on walks, held hands, sat alone in quiet corners, and even watched movies together. I taught her how to ride a bike, and in my head, we were like the perfect couple.
        <br /><br />
        She kept telling me, “Wait six months, and I’ll confess my love.” I waited patiently, with a hopeful heart, counting down the days, thinking, "This is it, this is how love is supposed to be." But when the seventh month came, something changed. She started ignoring me, and when I finally dug deeper, I found out the truth. She didn’t fall for me. No, she fell for my bike. She just needed someone to drive her around.
        <br /><br />
        I mean, who knew that a bike could get you more love than I did? It was a blow to the heart. I confronted her, and, well... it wasn’t pretty. She and her boyfriend turned against me, and I said some harsh words—words that were probably not very “charming.” She even threatened to call the police. Talk about a dramatic ending to what I thought was a fairytale. But that chapter closed, and I made a vow: no more girls for me. I became like a monk—no distractions, no heartbreak, just work.
        <br /><br />
        Fast forward a little while, and I joined Foundever. You’d think I’d learned my lesson, right? No more distractions. But then... you walked into my life. At first, it was just casual me doing my thing, you doing yours. But as the days passed, I couldn’t help but notice how stunning you looked. Seriously, it was like you were glowing. Slowly, I started complimenting you, dropping hints like breadcrumbs in a fairytale forest. "The dress does not look good; you look good in that dress!" "That smile!" "Is that how you look in the morning, or is this a magic trick?"
        <br /><br />
        We started talking more, and my feelings for you grew. But then, I learned something that made me hesitate you drank and smoked. For me, those are big red flags. I thought, “Not again!” But then, something amazing happened: you stopped drinking and smoking. And when I found out, I thought, “Did I have anything to do with this?” But soon, I realized that it wasn’t just for me it was for you, too. You were doing it for yourself and for others. That made me admire you even more. And let me just say, I felt like I was in the presence of a superhero. Who needs a cape when you have that much strength and willpower?
        <br /><br />
        When I finally told you how I felt, I was on cloud nine when you said you felt the same. It was like the universe finally gave me the green light. But then, things weren’t as simple as I thought. I noticed you giving more attention to another colleague. It broke my heart every time. But I kept my cool... for a while. Still, every time you chose him over me, I felt like my heart was doing a slow-motion free-fall. I asked you to stay away from him, but you didn’t listen. You know, stubbornness runs in the family, right?
        <br /><br />
        We fought a lot over this. I begged, pleaded, and even tried to bribe you with... well, I’m not proud of it. But even when you made it clear that he was more important to you, I stayed. I kept a smile on my face, acting like it didn’t hurt. One day, I completely lost it, and I said something horrible about him. And of course, you told me to apologize to him in front of everyone. That was a turning point for me. I showed my anger for the first time the deep, dramatic anger that only comes when you’ve watched one too many Tamil serials.
        <br /><br />
        After that, we didn’t talk for a day. But the next day, guess what? I couldn’t stay away. Every time I see you, my heart says, "Don’t lose her!" It’s like a little whisper in my chest that won’t leave me alone. Holding your hand, walking together, and even imagining you sleeping on my shoulder these are the things I see in my dreams. I didn’t mean to use you; I always cared for you.
        <br /><br />
        Did you eat? Did you get enough sleep? Asking those things isn’t my kind of care. My care is different I want to make you laugh, see you smile, and distract you from anything that hurts. That’s how I show love. 
        <br /><br />
        Didn’t I make you quit smoking? I stopped you from getting cancer! This is the kind of care I show. Most of my friends don’t drink or smoke because of me, and I’m proud to say that. This is how I care for someone by helping them be their best and healthiest self.
        <br /><br />
        And hey, those modern dresses you wear? They’re beautiful, but let me be honest when you wore that green traditional dress on Thursday, you looked like a million bucks. I noticed so many boys (and even girls) looking at you in awe. If I had to rate you out of 10, you’d easily be a 9. (I’m keeping that one point just to keep you humble!)
        <br /><br />
        I know you’ve asked me to be just friends, but I can’t. It’s too late for me. I don’t want a hundred friends; I want one person who loves me back.
        <br /><br />
        If you don’t want to be with me, I understand. But here’s my one request—please, no more drinking or smoking. If you ever feel like doing it, call me. I’ll talk to you, distract you with jokes, or even remind you of the bet we made about whose baby is going to be more beautiful. (Remember? The 10,00,000 rupee bet!) 
        <br /><br />
        So, I’ve set my heart on you, and I want you to know that I’m not letting go. No matter what, I’ll always care about you. If you ever feel something for me, even just a little, please let me know. Because no matter the distance or the silence, you’re always in my heart.

I’ll always keep trying to be the best version of myself for you, and I’ll never stop caring, because you’re worth every effort. Even if nothing else happens, I’ll treasure the memories the funny ones, the awkward ones, and the ones that made us laugh until we couldn’t breathe. You’ll always hold a special place in my heart... and I promise to keep your smile with me forever.

There’s no letting go.
