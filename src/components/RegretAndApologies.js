      <h2>Regrets and Apologies</h2>
      <p>
        1. I know I failed to ask the simple, yet important questions that would have shown you I truly care. 
        I didn’t ask if you’d eaten, if you’d slept well, or how your day went. I understand now that those small 
        gestures meant a lot to you, and I regret not paying attention to your needs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m truly sorry for not making the effort to show you that I care in the ways you wanted me to. 
      </p>
      <div className="apology-details">
        <p>
          I can’t take back the moments I’ve missed, but I want you to know that I’m learning from them.
          I realize now that true care isn’t just about grand gestures or big promises it’s in the little things, 
          the everyday actions that show someone you are thinking about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please know that my lack of attention wasn’t because I didn’t care, but because I failed to understand 
          what you needed at that time. I promise that from now on, I will ask how your day went, if you’ve eaten, 
          and if you’ve gotten the rest you deserve (until the countdown ends). Those simple things will be my way of showing you that I am here 
          for you in the way you need me to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I also want to apologize for something else I did that I now see was completely wrong. I always wanted to hold your hand, 
          to feel close to you. When I forced you to hold my hand at the office, I thought it might be a way for me to connect with you, 
          to be near you in a way that felt right to me. But looking back, I understand that it wasn’t my place to make that decision for you. 
          I know it made you uncomfortable, and I deeply regret not respecting your space and boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought you needed it, especially after seeing how you were with your friend, but I see now that my actions were out of line. 
          I should have never pushed you into something you didn’t want. I crossed a line that I should have respected from the start, 
          and for that, I am truly sorry.
        </p>
        <p>
          From now on, until the countdown ends, I will respect your space, and I promise to behave myself. I’ll no longer make any moves 
          that make you feel uncomfortable. I just want you to feel safe, respected, and in control of your own boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. One of my biggest regrets is the time when, out of anger, I shouted at you in front of everyone. 
          I disrespected you in front of others, and I am deeply sorry for doing that. No matter how upset I was, 
          that was never the right way to express my feelings, and I know now that it hurt you. You deserved my respect and understanding, 
          not humiliation or harsh words. I should have handled the situation with more maturity and kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can’t undo what I did, but I want you to know that I’ve learned from this mistake. You deserve to be treated with respect, 
          especially in difficult moments, and I failed to do that. I am truly sorry for causing you pain, and I promise to never disrespect you like that again.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. I regret not proposing to you properly, the way you deserved. I always wanted to get down on my knees and express my feelings for you 
          in the most sincere and heartfelt way, but I held back because I wasn't confident and was afraid of getting embarrassed in front of you. 
          Now, looking back, I realize that the fear of embarrassment was nothing compared to how important that moment was for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should have been brave enough to show you my love in the way that truly reflects how much you mean to me. 
          I deeply apologize for not doing it properly, and I regret not taking that step to make you feel truly special. You deserved a proposal 
          filled with love and respect, and I wish I had given you that.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. I regret flirting with other girls when you had feelings for me. At the time, I didn’t realize how deeply it would hurt you, 
          but now I see how wrong and inconsiderate my actions were. If I had known it would cause you pain, I would have never done it. 
          I should have been focused on you, the person who meant so much to me, instead of letting my attention wander to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I truly understood your worth, I couldn’t care less about anyone else. All I wanted was to be by your side, and I regret 
          not giving you my full attention earlier. I’m sorry for the hurt I caused and for not being the partner you deserved. 
          I should have been completely committed to you and only you.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. I always said that I trusted you, but I didn’t trust other boys, and looking back, I realize how wrong that was. If I truly trusted you, 
          I shouldn’t have worried about you being around other boys. I allowed my possessiveness to take over, and it ultimately harmed our relationship. 
          I let my insecurities and fears control me, and in doing so, I destroyed something that could have been beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I regret letting my lack of trust ruin what we had. You deserved better than that, and I’m deeply sorry for not respecting your space and 
          your autonomy. Trust should be unconditional, and I failed to show that to you. I’ll work on being a better person, and I promise to respect and trust you.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. I made you cry multiple times for no reason, and I can't begin to express how deeply I regret that. Every time I saw the pain in your eyes, 
          I should have realized how much I was hurting you, but instead, I let my actions and words cause you unnecessary sadness. 
        </p>
        <p>
          8. I am truly sorry for every time I made you feel this way. You deserved to be treated with love and kindness, not hurt or tears. I regret the 
          pain I caused you and promise to be more mindful of my actions in the future. I will do my best to never repeat the mistakes that led to your tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m truly sorry for disturbing you countless times, even after you clearly expressed that you were not interested in love. I should have respected your wishes 
          and given you the space you needed, but instead, I let my emotions guide my actions, and I regret doing that. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand how frustrating and unfair that must have been for you, and I deeply apologize for not listening to you. Please know that I will continue to respect your space 
          and will only reach out until the end of 2024. After that, I promise to be a new man and learn from my mistakes. I ask for your patience until then, and I hope I can make 
          things right in the future.
